# ASAM ODS CORBA API Java Library

This library is the compiled interface of the [ASAM ODS](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/ods/) standard. It should be compatible with previous APIs generated by both the JacORB and the Java SUN ORB.

Note, that in order to build this API locally you will require to put the ods*.idl file into the project's src/main/idl folder. The .idl file, however, is only available to ASAM members. Still, the resulting artifact is freely usable by any client and is therefore published on Maven central by this project. This project's version number aligns with the respective ASAM ODS API version, at the time of writing this documentation it is the standard's version 5.3.1. The fourth version number part is reserved for any changes on this project without changing the underlying ODS API version.

## Deployment

The build of the zip and the jars is done locally and the zip artifact is committed to the repository under the target folder. A build on GitHub is impossible because of the ods*.idl files not being public domain but restricted by [ASAM license](https://www.asam.net/license/). The GitHub release process attaching the zip triggers automatically when a tag "v*" is pushed. The deployment of the jar to Maven central is also done locally, since it was not possible to create a useful GitHub Action that releases pre-built artifacts to Maven central.
