Library for the ASAM ODS CORBA API - NOTICE

This library is compiled from the ASAM ODS (https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/ods/) CORBA API IDL file, provided by ASAM to its members. While the IDL file is seen as restricted to members only by the ASAM license (https://www.asam.net/license/), the resulting jar file from an IDL compiler is not restricted or at least tolerated by ASAM to be publicly available and provided by Peak Solution GmbH (https://www.peak-solution.de).

This product includes no third-party libraries.

Please see the LICENSE file for more information about licensing.

The CORBA API implementation of Eclipse Glassfish ORB is required at build time. The runtime environment of the application using this ASAM ODS CORBA API should provide the same ORB. Other implementations may cause issues and are not officially supported.

This library makes a few changes to the resulting Java API classes to improve compatibility with clients using older API generated by JacORB as well as Java SUN ORB.
